# Address Book Project

This project implements a fully functioning address book based on a binary search tree data structure. Entries in the address
book are placed in the tree ranked by their ID number. The user can also search the address book by looking for a specific 
character or substring. All functions follow standard BST traversal techniques.

# How to run/test

in. The user can run any tests as specified by the directions of the program.
