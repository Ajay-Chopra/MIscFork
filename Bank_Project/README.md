This project is a simulation of a standard bank management software, written in C++. The program allows the user to create a
new customer profile, add accounts and perform transactions with those accounts such as depositing, withdrawing and transfering
funds. The goal of the project was to become familiar with object-oritented programming in C++ and hence utilizes several OOP 
concepts. 

### HOW TO RUN/TEST
To run this program, all you need is a standard compiler for C++ (I used clang) and an IDE to view the code in. The directions
given throughout the program should make testing rather easy. The user should feel free to write any inputs as specified by the
directions given.

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
