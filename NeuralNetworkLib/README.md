# Three Layer Neural Network Library
This folder contains the source code for a neural network library written in C++. The library allows a user to create a three layer neural 
network with a specified number of inputs nodes, hidden nodes and output nodes. The user can also define their own bias and alpha/learning
rate. The user can then use the library to train data and receive a brief output containing the MSE for the data. Obviously, compared to
more professional neural network libraries this is rather primitive. However, I mostly wrote it as a means of becoming familiar with the
concepts of neural network structure, feed forward algorithms, backpropogation and gradient descent.
