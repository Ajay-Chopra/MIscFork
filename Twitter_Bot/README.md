# My First Twitter Bot

This is a simple Twitter bot I created in Python using the tweepy package. Given a handle, the bot will immediately retweet any Tweet
from that account. 

### Directions for Use

In order to use this bot, the user must have a Twitter Developer account and create a Twitter app. They must also generate their own API keys.
