# My First Twitter Bot

This is a simple Twitter bot I created in Python using the tweepy package. Given a handle, the bot will immediately retweet any Tweet from that account. 

### Directions for Use

In order to use this bot, the user must have a Twitter Developer account and create a Twitter app. They must also generate their own API keys.
I have obvioulsy removed mine for privacy reasons. 

### Acknowledgements
Credit goes to CSDojo for giving me the idea for this project as well as several implementation hints.
